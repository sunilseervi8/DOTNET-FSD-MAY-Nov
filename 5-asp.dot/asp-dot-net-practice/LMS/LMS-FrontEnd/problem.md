# React Hachaton- Duration: 3 Hours

## Problem Statement 
Create a React application to manage course details efficiently. The app should provide a user-friendly interface for adding, viewing, and editing courses.

## Requirement
1. Functional Approach: Use functional components throughout the application.
2. React Material UI: Design the user interface using React Material UI components for a consistent and visually appealing look.
3. Components:
    1. Header: Contains navigation links to the Application, "Add Course," and "View Courses" pages.
    2. AddCourse: A form for entering course details (name, duration, price, start date).
    3. ViewCourse: Displays a list of all available courses in a card or paper format.
    4. Dashboard: The main page with navigation links to "Add Course" and "View Courses."
4. Use the App authentication 
5. Data Storage: Use a db.json file to store course and User data.
6. Routing: Implement routing using a library like React Router to handle navigation between different pages.

## Endpoints:

``` 
1. localhost:3000: Displays the dashboard page.
2. localhost:3000/course: Displays a list of all courses.
3. localhost:3000/addCourse: Displays the "Add Course" form.
4. localhost:3000/login: user login the app 
5. localhost:3000/register : register a new User 
```


### Additional Considerations:

# Error Handling: 
    Implement error handling mechanisms to provide informative messages to the user in case of invalid inputs or data issues.
# Data Validation: 
    Ensure that the entered course data is valid (e.g., check for required fields, data types).
# Responsiveness: 
    Design the app to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
# Accessibility: 
    Consider accessibility guidelines to make the app usable by people with disabilities.
# Testing: 
    Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code and catch potential bugs early.
